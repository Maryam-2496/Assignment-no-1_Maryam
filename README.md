🍔 Cafeteria Management System – C++ Console Application

**Overview**

The Cafeteria Management System is a simple yet effective C++ console-based application designed to streamline order management, billing, and sales reporting for a cafeteria. It supports multi-customer ordering, calculates itemized bills, tracks inventory sales, and generates weekly/monthly sales reports—all within a single session.

**🔧 Features**

📋 Menu-Driven Interface : – Allows customers to view available items with dynamic pricing.

🧾 Itemized Billing: – Calculates total price based on quantity and item selected.

👥 Multi-Customer Support: – Processes orders for multiple customers in a loop.

📊 Sales Reporting: – Generates detailed weekly and monthly sales reports for cafeteria performance insights.

📈 Sales Tracking: – Tracks how many times each item is sold per session.

☎️ Customer Info Logging: – Records customer name and phone number for each transaction.

🧠 How It Works

The system prompts for the number of customers.

Each customer is guided through an ordering menu.

The program records the customer's order and contact info.

After completing the order, it calculates the total bill.

Optionally, it generates a Weekly and/or Monthly sales report.

The admin can continue serving more customers or exit.
